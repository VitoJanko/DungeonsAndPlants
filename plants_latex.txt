\subsection{Thiefs Dream}
\small\emph{Cave} \\ 
\paragraph{Encounter}
You have tracked the general location of this plant, but it grows in the middle of a rock, with no visible outwards signs. Choose a spot (Wisdom skill check). A mining team (or similar) can excavate this spot in one day. If the result of the roll was 20 or higher, find the plant. Can be repeated each day.
\paragraph{Permanent}
Wood and stone obstacles that are up to 10 ft. thick appear transparent to you. You may freely walk through them, as long as you end your turn outside.
\end{samepage} 

\begin{samepage}
\subsection{Tree of the Living Death}
\small\emph{Arid, Arctic, Forest, Mountain, Cave} \\ 
\paragraph{Consumed}
You appear dead to all outward inspection and to spells used to determine your status. You are blinded and incapacitated. (6 hours)
\paragraph{Alchemy kit (3 days), 500g materials}
Potion. After exactly 6 hours, if the creature that consumed this potion has 100 hp or fewer, it dies with no discernible signs.
\end{samepage} 

\section{Proficiency +6}


\begin{samepage}
\subsection{Immortal Lily}
\small\emph{Arid, Arctic, Forest, Plains, Mountain, Cave, Coast, Tropics} \\ 
\paragraph{Encounter}
You encounter a CR 17+ dragon (at DM discretion) that is not aggressive, but would defend the lily with its life.
\paragraph{Consumed (does not end when used)}
If unconscious on your turn, instead of death-saving throws, regain 1 hp (1 day).
\paragraph{Laboratory, 10000g materials, Consumed}
You do not age for the next 25 years.

\section*{Roll Tables}
This project is designed for use with the online generator (https://www.dungeonsandplants.net/). 
    For offline games, utilize one of the generated roll tables. Each terrain/proficiency features its own table, 
    so choose and print the most suitable one for your current level and location. 
    Some tables require you to roll multiple dice, in this cases not all plants are found with equal probability. // //
    The abundance of tables makes the system somewhat cumbersome, so a more streamlined version is currently under development.
